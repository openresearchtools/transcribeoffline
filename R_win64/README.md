If you decide to run Transcribe Offline via R, you can do it by using R studio (we only tested in R studio).
***To install and run Transcribe Offline in R studio, simply download setup_transcribe_offline.R select all text in the script and run.***
By default it will download contents to your Downloads folder. It will automatically open model download GUI after instalattion.

***To run it after, use run_transcribe_offline.R which will be automatically created***
If it fails, select Transcribe_Offline as working directory try again.
